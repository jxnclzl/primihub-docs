# Primihub Open Source Community Governance

In order to create a space for free learning and communication for those interested in the Primihub project, the Primihub open source community is now launched. Welcome you to share your ideas~

Under the community organization structure, there are three different organizations，PMC,User Group,Developer Group.

## PMC
The top-level governance structure of the community We draw on the concept of PMC (Project Management Committee) of the Apache Foundation, that is, the Project Management Committee, which participates in the formulation of the Primihub community project Primihub and major community-related resolutions.

## User Group
*User Group*, Primihub User Group (PUG) is an independent, non-profit third-party organization initiated by Primihub users. Users implement self-management and aim to enhance communication and learning among Primihub users. The forms of TUG include but are not limited to online Q&A and technical article sharing, offline technical salons, visiting famous enterprises, official interactive activities, etc. TUG members can learn cutting-edge technical knowledge, express technical insights, and jointly build the Primihub project through online and offline activities.
With the maturity of Primihub products, the user group of Primihub has grown. The feedback and practical experience of users in the process of use play an important role in the improvement and application promotion of Primihub products. It is hoped that users and developers will have more Good communication and interaction, together to promote the healthy development of the Primihub community.

## Developer Group
*Developer Group*, is often referred to as the developer community. In the developer community, including the familiar Contributor, Committer and Maintainer.

Considering that with more and more projects in the Primihub community in the future, the Primihub and PrimiManager projects themselves will become more and more complex, so the Primihub community has introduced the concept of Special Interest Group (SIG) governance:   
  

> Special Interest Group (SIG), SIG is a very old term, it first appeared in the 1970s, because of the various mailing list mailing groups formed by the ARPAnet network, this is also the prototype of the open source community . The Primihub community has also adopted such an ancient and widely used form of organization (word) in the open source community. SIG is mainly responsible for the development and maintenance of a module such as Primihub, and is responsible for the quality of the module code. Contributors who meet the conditions will be invited to join the special interest group, and developers will receive continuous guidance from Tech Leads and active Committers in the special interest group to optimize and improve the module while exercising their technical abilities. Community developers can gradually grow from the initial Contributor to the Committer and Maintainer recognized by the community through special interest groups. Generally speaking, each special interest group will periodically organize meetings to discuss recent progress and problems encountered. All meeting discussions are open to the community, so that interested students can participate and discuss together. 

In the Primihub project, the Primihub community divides it into: SIG of FL (Federated Learning Interest Group), SIG of TEE (Trusted Privacy Computing Group), SIG of HE (Homomorphic Encryption Interest Group), SIG of MPC (Multi-party Security) Computational Privacy Group), SIG of HA (Hardware Acceleration, Hardware Acceleration Interest Group), etc.
