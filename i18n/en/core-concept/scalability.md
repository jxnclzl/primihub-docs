# Scalability

*** What can Primihub extend? ***

![Extensilbe](./extensilbe-layer.svg)

Primihub can be extended from the following aspects.

## Data source access extension

Primihub supports different types of data sources to be registered in the Primihub resource network as datasets. Users can use the data source extension framework to encapsulate their own data sources to access the Primihub privacy computing network.

## Data consumption expansion

The result data generated by privacy computing can be used for user-defined downstream data consumption through data consumption extension.

## Access application extension

Through common application interfaces, Primihub can support external application access in scenarios such as big data, machine learning, and IoT.

## Syntax layer extension

Supports the expansion of complex privacy computing tasks written in different languages.

Currently Primihub only supports Protobuf and Python languages.

## Semantic Layer Extension

* The semantic layer parser infers which task scheduling to use according to the multi-party safe semantics (context), and creates different types of schedulers;
* The scheduler starts the Worker on the distributed node according to the assigned task type;
* Distributed node workers start corresponding tasks according to their assigned semantics;
* Task runs by selecting the corresponding protocol;

## Protocol layer extensions

The protocol here refers specifically to the "security protocol". The extension of the protocol corresponds to the extension of the upper-layer Task, including: ABY3, PSI, PIR, cheeth, secure xgboost, etc. Cryptographic engineers can develop custom security protocols and access the Primihub platform according to the protocol specifications.

For how to extend the security protocol, see the developer guide [protocol development guide](developer-docs/protocol-dev-guide.md)
